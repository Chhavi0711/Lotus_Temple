# Lotus_Temple
This project involves the fabrication of a scaled structural model of the Lotus Temple using galvanized iron sheets and metalworking processes such as cutting, bending, and riveting.

## Description
The Lotus Temple Project is a manufacturing-based exercise focused on replicating the unique architecture of the Lotus Temple in New Delhi. The structure features 27 marble-like petals arranged in a symmetrical flower-like layout. The project was executed using galvanized iron sheets to model three petal sizes, joined to an upper and lower platform to ensure symmetry and structural integrity. All components were designed and assembled by the team using mechanical fabrication techniques.

## Features
- Scaled Architectural Model: Accurately replicates the geometric form of the Lotus Temple.

- Symmetrical Petal Arrangement: Designed to match the original 27-petal structure using grouped sections.

- Mechanical Fabrication: Involves cutting, bending, riveting, and brazing for precision assembly.

- Modular Design: Petals and platforms were fabricated and joined in stages for structural accuracy.

## Technologies & Processes Used
- Galvanized Iron Sheets: Used as the main material for constructing petals and base elements.

- Cutting, Bending & Riveting: Applied for shaping and joining metal components.

- Orthographic & Isometric Drawings: Used for part visualization and dimension accuracy (via CAD-based sketches).

- Manual Tools & Skill-Based Techniques: Developed hands-on skills in fitting, assembly, and layout.
